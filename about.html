            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Penn Neuroethology Group is a leading research collective at the University of Pennsylvania, 
                dedicated to advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior 
                in primates. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates computational models, deep learning techniques, 
                and innovative neurotechnology to explore the complexities of the primate brain.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in [Year] by a team of pioneering researchers, the group has grown to include faculty 
                and students from a variety of disciplines. Together, we have pushed the boundaries of computational 
                neuroethology, contributing valuable insights to the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and 
                computational biology.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to decode the neural language of social interaction and cognitive processes in 
                primates. By merging empirical research with computational methods, we aim to construct detailed 
                models that can predict and elucidate behavior. Through our work, we strive to not only advance 
                scientific knowledge but also to apply our findings to real-world challenges in medicine, 
                artificial intelligence, and conservation.
            </p>

        <section id="methodologies">
            <h2>Methodologies</h2>
            <p>
                Employing a multidisciplinary toolkit, we engage in deep phenotyping of social interactions 
                in naturalistic settings. Our labs are equipped with state-of-the-art neuroimaging technology, 
                wireless neurorecording devices, and custom-developed software for pose estimation and behavior 
                analysis. Our computational models are honed through machine learning algorithms and big data 
                analytics, providing a window into the complex dance of neuronal networks.
