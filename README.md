### About the Group
Welcome to the Penn Neuroethology Group at the University of Pennsylvania. We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers dedicated to unraveling the complexities of neural behavior through the lens of computational neuroethology. Situated in the vibrant heart of Philadelphia, our group combines state-of-the-art computational methods with deep ethological insights to decode the neural substrates of natural behaviors and cognitive processes in myriad model organisms, including songbirds, primates, and rodents.

### Join Us
We are always on the lookout for passionate researchers, students, and collaborators who are eager to contribute to our understanding of the brain's role in natural behavior. If you are drawn to the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and ethology, the Penn Neuroethology Group offers a fertile ground for exploration and discovery.
